# FDR

Declarative routing as easy as `Widget.build`.

## Features

FDR enables you to derive the displayed pages and navigation stack from your app's state – at all times.
When used in combination with proper state modelling as the basis, this allows for complex navigation flows that'll always work. No more `push` and `popUntil` that might be slightly different in every scenario.
